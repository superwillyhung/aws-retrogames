# aws-retrogames

As part of the AWS builders challenge, builders have been asked to build retro games as part of the challenge. So I have started a post on my steps and observations. 

Steps to get started: 

1) Sign up for an AWS builders account.
2) Sign up for Github account, as requested from the aws challenege to submit your code and documenation.
3) Set up your computer, with an IDE to help you build, like VS code.
4) Install extensions to help you like Amazon Q.
5) Sign in to the extension using your Amazon Builders account to access Amazon Q developer.
6) Start coding by providing a detailed prompt of what you want to build.
7) Save and test your project!
8) Check if you want to update anything in your project using further Amazon Q developer prompts.
9) Once happy, you can also use Amazon Q developer to help you document your code and notes.
10) Share your experiences! - That should be it!
